    <h1>What is SHPE?</h1>
    <p>The society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group
        of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of
        professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic Community.</p>
    <p>The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters
        to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside of the United
        States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professionals and student chapters throughout the
        nation.</p>

    <h1>SHPE's Mission</h1>

    <p>SHPE changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world
        through STEM awareness, access, support and development.</p>

        through the use of science and technology. We value excellence in education, professional pursuits and
        leadership. We obtain excellence through integrity, empowerment, achievement, diversity and continuous
        improvement.</p>
